# What was done with the R Script

1. Merging of training and test data set into one
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. It was appropriately labeled so the data set was filled with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
